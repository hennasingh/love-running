# Love Running

Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and
keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club.
